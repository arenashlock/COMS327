    - Made the files for the assignment
    - Created the Makefile script
    - Wrote the code to generate the borders and small grass
    - Wrote the code to print the map

9/6/2023 8:20 PM
    - Wrote the code to generate the entrances and exits for the paths
    - Wrote the code to generate 2 regions of tall grass and 1 region of water
    - Wrote the code to generate the N->S road and the W->E road

9/7/2023 1:30 PM
    - Moved the code to generate the base map and print the map into functions outside of main and call them within main

9/8/2023 2:00 PM
    - Rewrote the code to generate terrain since my original version were square patches
        - I also put this in a separate function and call it from my main
    - Rewrote the code to generate the roads
    - Wrote the code to spawn the Pokemon Center and the Pokemart

9/13/2023 9:00 PM
    - Changed the map to be a struct for this round of development
    - Moved the terrain generation functions (from 1.01) to a new file called "terrain.c" and modified accordingly to work with the struct
    - Changed a little functionality so that the gates were stored in the struct for future reference
    - Added the equation for probability of generating a Pokemon Center and Pokemart

9/14/2023 1:15 PM
    - Added functionality for the commands

9/15/2023 1:00 PM
    - Fixed a bug that was preventing the gates from lining up
    - Also fixed a bug that was reading in the newline character, so my map was printing twice
    - Implemented some edge correction to "despawn" gates that are on the edge of the world

9/16/2023 9:45 AM
    - Fixed a bug that made my program crash when I flew to map (200, 200)

9/21/2023 4:00 PM
    - Changed map generation to enumeration

9/22/2023 6:45 AM
    - Copied over the heap files and Dijkstra's algorithm from the path generation
    - Modified the algorithm somewhat to get code compiling (segmentation fault though)

9/22/2023 9:00 AM
    - Made a header file for the player since it seems like we may want that in the future
    - Added a function to spawn the player on a road

9/22/2023 10:00 AM
    - Removed the command functionality since we are only generating Dijkstra's algorithm once
    - Put in code to print the Dijkstra values

9/22/2023 3:00 PM
    - Made switch cases for the terrain cost of each NPC
    - Added a for loop to do the Dijkstra calculations
    - Code is functional aside from a segmentation fault due to the while loop (occasionally functional with a temporary for loop)

9/25/2023: 10:25 AM
    - Went to the instructor's Office Hours and fixed the bug!
        - The issue was that I didn't initialize to NULL, my conditional was accessing spots it wasn't supposed to

9/25/2023 5:15 PM
    - Fixed an error where the player only got spawned once, so sometimes the values were negative

10/01/2023 2:00 PM
    - Removed the unnecessary functionality from previous assignments

10/04/2023 1:45 PM
    - Collapsed all the files into just the heap files and the main file (ashlock_aren.assignment1.04)
    - Changed my terrain cost array function to index the array given in 1.03 solution

------ SWITCHED TO THE PROFESSOR'S CODE ------

10/05/2023 2:00 PM
    - Attempted to spawn NPCs into the game
        - Lead to a segmentation fault

10/08/2023 8:00 AM
    - Realized I forgot to initialize the heap, so I implemented the necessary stuff which fixed the error
    - Wrote the code to spawn the NPCs

10/08/2023 8:45 PM
    - Made the final part of the NPC spawn
    - Wrote the movement functions for each kind of NPC
        - Results in an error that generates one new map but gets stuck

10/09/2023 8:50 AM
    - Fixed the infinite loop issue
        - Movement is still broken in some way

10/09/2023 10:40 AM
    - Implemented the input for the number of characters

10/09/2023 7:15 PM
    - Changed the input to be the proper format
    - Started trying to debug where the movement issue is occurring (seems to be an issue with moving the rival/hiker only)
    - Fixed the movement issue
        - Realized I forgot to update the min value in finding the min spot to move to
    - Only issue remaining is an infinite side-to-side when a character reaches the pc
    - Fixed the loop issue
        - Realized I was inserting into the heap twice

10/16/2023 6:30 PM
    - Implemented the ncurses library
        - Included the initialization
        - Updated the print_map method
        - Modified the game loop to wait for user input
    - Made it so there was baseline player movement and the ability to stay put or quit

10/17/2023 9:15 AM
    - Added in curses colors

10/17/2023 2:15 PM
    - Changed functionality so we detect ineligible terrain and don't move any character
    - Made it so the battle funcationality is there

10/17/2023 9:00 PM
    - Implemented entering and exiting buildings
    - Made a trainer list with up and down arrows

10/18/2023 12:45 AM
    - Fixed the battle function so that npcs stop moving and get marked as defeated
    - Made it so both the npcs and the pc can initiate battles
