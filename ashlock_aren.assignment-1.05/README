This program is fully functional to the specifications.
All key mappings are as specified per the instructions.
    You can move the player around
    If you are standing on top of a building, you can enter and exit
    At any point, you may bring up a list of trainers and scroll through it if it is too large for the screen
    When an NPC or the PC moves into one another (while the NPC is not defeated), a battle occurs
        Pressing the escape key exits the battle and marks the NPC as defeated
        Defeated NPCs no longer move
