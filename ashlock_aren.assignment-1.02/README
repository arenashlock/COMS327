This program is capable of generating a world of maps to the complete specifications of the assignment.
Each map meets the previous criteria from Assignment 1.01.
Able to execute the 6 commands (illegal commands are ignored).
Going from map to map connects existing gates.
If at a map on the edge of the world, the edge gates aren't spawned.
On that note, if a user is on the edge and tries to move out of bounds, it ignores that command.
I applied the probability equation of spawning buildings aside from the starting map (guaranteed to spawn in map (0, 0)).
