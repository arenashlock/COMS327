For assignment-2, I decided to make the best computer game, MINESWEEPER!
All the controls for the game are in the game screen, but it is purely a keyboard input game.
There are 2 modes the game runs in:
    * First, you need to run 'make' to build the program
    1. Run './minesweeper' to run the game like it is supposed to normally run
    2. Run './minesweeper cheat' to run the game in cheat mode
        This marks all the mines, so don't reveal those if you want to win!
        The main reason for including this mode is for the TAs to be able to see that the game works as it should
You can play as many games as you want (by pressing 'n' after each game), or you can quit.

HAVE FUN!
