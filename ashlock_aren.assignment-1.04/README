This program is fully functional to the specifications.
To specify the number of traingers to spawn:
    Run the program using ./poke327 --numtrainers #.
    Otherwise, I have it hardcoded to spawn 6-12 NPCs with 1 rival and 1 hiker guaranteed if no argument is provided.
All movement works for each kind of NPC and continues forever until the user kills the program.
The PC does not move at all from it's spawn point.
