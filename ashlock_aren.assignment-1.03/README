This program continues to have the functionality of the previous assignments, but also incorporates the specifications from Assignment 1.03.
Each map spawns a "player" character on a random road block.
Using that position, we run Dijkstra's algorithm and print the costs from eachsquare.
The hiker cost map prints first and the rival cost map prints below.
You can still switch from map to map, it just spawns the player in a new random spot for each one.
    ** The position of the player doesn't get stored for a map since that won't be necessary in the future. **
